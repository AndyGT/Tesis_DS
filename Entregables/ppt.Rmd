##Objectives

Develop and apply methods to assess the suitability of using news flows and precipitation data to characterize disater damages in Mexico looking forward to resource allocation improvement( disaster managment).

We will work towards explaining the determinants of declaring or not declaring a disaster 

##Working plan 

* Analyze information flows using Newspaper, TV and radio data.
* Correlation of news flows with precipitation data.
* Correlation of news flows with damage  metrics (evaluation and public expenditure).
* Accompanying interactive visualization tools
